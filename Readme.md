# Ghostty Terminal Configuration

I love using the Ghostty terminal because of its minimalistic design and customizable features. It offers a distraction-free environment that perfectly suits my workflow. I am adding more keybinding and loves discovering it more.

Some of my favorite aspects include:
- The ability to hide window decorations for a clean look.
- Seamless split and tab management for multitasking.
- Customizable themes and opacity for a visually pleasing setup.
- Tmux-like keybindings that enhance productivity.
