# Ghostty Terminal Configuration

I love using the Ghostty terminal because of its minimalistic design and customizable features. It offers a distraction-free environment that perfectly suits my workflow. I am adding more keybinding and loves discovering it more.

Some of my favorite aspects include:
- The ability to hide window decorations for a clean look.
- Seamless split and tab management for multitasking.
- Customizable themes and opacity for a visually pleasing setup.
- Tmux-like keybindings that enhance productivity.

Ghostty makes terminal usage efficient and enjoyable, reflecting my preferences for simplicity and functionality. If you enjoy tweaking settings and optimizing your terminal experience, Ghostty is a great choice!
